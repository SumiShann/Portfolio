                As a front-end developer, Iâ€™m interested in giving life to your ideas, 
                wild as they may be, in order to create the website that fits <i>your</i> needs.
            </p>
            <p>
                I mainly use React, and can partner up with a back-end developer 
                for a dynamic website project.
            </p>
            <p>
